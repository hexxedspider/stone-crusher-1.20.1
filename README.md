### I WILL UPDATE THIS README.md WHEN I GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY FOR ME

# Stone Crusher

The Stone Crusher is a new block used to turn Cobblestone (or any stone you may find in the Overworld) into Gravel. Use fuel to power it, and let it work! The Stone Crusher can also crush Gravel into Sand. No need to build a Sand duper anymore!

The Stone Crusher is fast and energy efficient. Feeding it a single plank allows it to crush 6 blocks. Pretty cool, right?

**Crafting recipe:**

- 5 stones from the overworld (cobbled, bricks, tiles, etc. Whatever you have handy.)
- 2 Stonecutters
- 1 Blast Furnace
- 1 Stone


### Credits & Acknowledgments

* Thanks to Rumaruka for the initial Stone Crusher model, taken from [Simple Grinder](https://modrinth.com/mod/simplegrinder). I've edited it to look more Deepslate-y.

* Thanks to Kauperjoe for [his modding tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pr_iHlVKsI&list=PLKGarocXCE1EO43Dlf5JGh7Yk-kRAXUEJ).

* Thanks to Blyrium for the original mod, I just updated it to 1.21 for my own world.

### A few notes

* Supports EMI.

* Supports REI.

* JEI will not be supported.

* This mod **will not (potentially) work on 1.20.2 and above**. 1.20 and 1.20.1 are the only two fully supported versions. I will not update/backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft, but you're free to do so yourself if you wish (as I am trying.)
